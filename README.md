# Waveform Windows Game

Developed in a team of three using Unity3D in a span of two days for Global Games Jam 2017. 



Waveform is a game about a teddy bear who is on the hunt to be united with his friend called Doggo, a plush puppy. Teddy uses wave based collectibles to overcome the obstacles standing in the way between him and doggo. He has to be aware of the nutcrackers though, who are on a mission to stop him. The game uses a mouse based gameplay. This means the game uses a mouse and left click for all movements. You have to click on a block to move teddy to the block. The game consists of 3 levels. There is a how to play section in the main menu which should be read for better understanding and how to play.
